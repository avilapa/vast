DirectXTex missing compiled shaders:
====================================

Error in VS:

vast\vendor\dx12\DirectXTex\DirectXTex\BCDirectCompute.cpp(23,10): fatal error C1083: Cannot open include file: 'BC7Encode_EncodeBlockCS.inc': No such file or directory

Fix: Need to execute vast\vendor\dx12\DirectXTex\DirectXTex\Shaders\CompileShaders.cmd

----

Error in CompileShaders.cmd:

'fxc.exe' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

Fix: Copy fxc.exe to the vast\vendor\dx12\DirectXTex\DirectXTex\Shaders\ directory and execute CompileShaders.cmd again.
